I'VE COMPLETED MY TASK IN ANALYSING TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS DATA TO IDENTIFY THE PATTERN RELATED TO THE ROAD CONDITIONS ,WEATHER AND
ACCIDENT HOTSPOTS USING TABLEAU. FROM THIS I HAVE GAINED VARIOUS INSIGHTS ABOUT THE DATASETS.

üå•üå• CLIMATIC CONDITIONS: FROM THE VISUALIZING CLIMATE AND FATALITIES
I CAME TO A CONCLUSION THAT ACCIDENTS IN THE STATES IS NOT FULLY DEPENDED ON ITS CLIMATE AS THE ACCIDENTS IN CLEAR WEATHER IS MORE WHEN COMPARED WITH OTHER CLIMATIC CONDITIONS.

üò±üò± AGE: IN THIS DATASETS MOST OF THE FATAL ACCIDENTS ARE CAUSED BY PEOPLE IN THEIR MIDDLE AGE WHICH PLAYS A HUGE ROLE IN THE FATALITIES. THIS BREAKS THE STEREOTYPE THAT MOST OF THE ACCIDENTS ARE CAUSED BY PEOPLE IN THEIR 20'S.

üåéüåé ACCIDENT HOTSPOTS: MOST OF THE FATALITIES TOOK PLACE IN RURAL LOCAL ROAD SOUTH DAKOTA AND COLRANDO.

üçªüçª INFLUENCE OF ALCOHOL:IN THIS THE ALCOHOL RESULTS FOR THE ACCIDENTS IS REPORTED MORE WHICH CAN BE NAMED AS ONE THE FACTORS WHICH CONTRIBUTES TO THE DAMAGES.

THESE ARE THE INSIGHTS I GAINED FROM WORKING WITH THE DATASETS
AND VISUALIZING IT WITH TABLEAU PLAYS AN EFFECTIVE ROLE IN THE TASK COMPLETION.
